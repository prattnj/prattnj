## Projects

### Music Metrics
#### Repo: [prattnj/music-metrics](https://github.com/prattnj/music-metrics)
#### Website: [musicmetrics.app](https://musicmetrics.app)
A web application that tracks a user's Spotify listening and computes interesting statistics from it. Backend is written in Go, using
MySQL with good database design principles to store listening history as well as song and album metadata.
Frontend uses ReactJS to provide a clean, seamless web UI for users to see their stats among other things.

### GoatHouse Pizza
#### Repo: [prattnj/goathousepizza](https://github.com/prattnj/goathousepizza)
#### Website: [goathousepizza.com](https://goathousepizza.com)
A website for a brick oven pizza business that I helped start in 2022. Uses Vanilla JavaScript to provide an ordering platform for
customers, integrating Microsoft Azure Functions along with Google's Calendar API to schedule orders.

### Interactive Portfolio
#### Repo: [prattnj/noahpratt](https://github.com/prattnj/noahpratt)
#### Website: [noahpratt.com](https://noahpratt.com)
A website created as a way to visualize my resume. Uses 3JS to design and render interactive polyhedrons that display information.
Additionally, uses Vite as a JavaScript build tool and other basic development tools like Git.

### Chess Application
#### Repo: private for academic integrity, email for access
#### Website: in development
Created by professors and TA's including myself as a project for the students of a Software Engineering class at BYU. Uses
good software design principles and modern technologies to implement a fully functional chess server and client, both
written in Java. Communication is done via REST API and WebSocket. A web-based client is currently in development.
