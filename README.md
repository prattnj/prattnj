### Music Metrics
#### Repo: [prattnj/music-metrics](https://github.com/prattnj/music-metrics)
#### Website: [musicmetrics.app](https://musicmetrics.app)
A web application that tracks a user's Spotify listening and computes interesting statistics from it. Backend is written in Go, using
MySQL with good database design principles to store listening history as well as song and album metadata.
Frontend uses ReactJS to provide a clean, seamless web UI for users to see their stats among other things.

### Chess Application
#### Repo: private for academic integrity, email for access
#### Website: in development
Created by professors and TA's including myself as a project for the students of a Software Engineering class at BYU. Uses
good software design principles and modern technologies to implement a fully functional chess server and client, both
written in Java. Communication is done via REST API and WebSocket. A web-based client is currently in development.

## Other Public Repos
